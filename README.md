## MaxStack
    
Question: Design a max stack that supports push, pop, peek, peekMax and popMax.

1. push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
2. pop() -- Remove the element on top of the stack and return it.
3. peek() -- Get the element on the top.
4. peekMax() -- Retrieve the maximum element in the stack.
5. popMax() -- Retrieve the maximum element in the stack, and remove it. If you find more than one maximum elements, only remove the top-most one.
