## [InsertSort](https://github.com/gucheng0712/LearningDataStructure/tree/master/DataStructureStudy/005-InsertSort)
Insert sort is a simple sorting algorithm. The principle is to scan the unsorted data from back to front in the sorted sequence, find the corresponding position and insert.
In the process of backward scanning, the sorted elements need to be moved backward step by step repeatedly to provide insertion space for the latest elements.

Time Complexity:

* Average: O (n ^ 2)
* Best: O(n)
* Worst: O (n ^ 2)
    
## [SelectSort](https://github.com/gucheng0712/LearningDataStructure/tree/master/DataStructureStudy/006-SelectSort)
Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm.
It works as follows:
    First, find the smallest (large) element in the unsorted sequence, store it at the beginning of the sorted sequence, then continue to find the smallest (large) element from the remaining unsorted elements, and then put it at the end of the sorted sequence. and so on until all the elements are sorted.
    
Time Complexity:
    O (n ^ 2)

# Programming Questions
## [MaxStack]
    
Question: Design a max stack that supports push, pop, peek, peekMax and popMax.

1. push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
2. pop() -- Remove the element on top of the stack and return it.
3. peek() -- Get the element on the top.
4. peekMax() -- Retrieve the maximum element in the stack.
5. popMax() -- Retrieve the maximum element in the stack, and remove it. If you find more than one maximum elements, only remove the top-most one.

## [EncodingAndDecoding]

Question: Design the encode and decode methods. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a string can be encoded to a a code and the code can be decoded to the original URL.
